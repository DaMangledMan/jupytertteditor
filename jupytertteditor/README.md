# Overview

The purpose of this library will be to Create, Edit, and Display Truth Tables of any size. 

I wrote this software because I was searching for something that would simplify the process of creating truth tables, but I was unable to find anything that did something remotely close to what I wanted. In the end I wrote this to streamline the entire process down to a few lines of code.

# Development Environment

I programmed the entire thing inside of VS Code using Python 3.11.9. I also had the Gemini Code Assist extension enabling faster production. I also will be installing and using the following libraries: setuptools, wheel, twine, and multiprocess.

# Future Work

- Currently has functionality to create a truth table of any size, but it is incredibly slow to create them after a certain size is reached considering the nature of truth table length being 2^n possible scenarios (n being the number of vaiables in the truth table). There are plans to add multiprocessing to help speed up the process of creating truth tables.
